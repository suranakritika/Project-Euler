# Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

In the program, I used sum of natural numbers which is `n*(n+1)/2` with difference of 3, 5 and 15 to find the multiples of 3, 5 and deduct the multiples of 15.
